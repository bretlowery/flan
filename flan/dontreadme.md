## THE STORY OF FLAN, A STUDENT OF ZEN

Zen Master: You have come to me for wisdom. Instead, I shall give you log files.

Student: (giving Master serious side-eye) And what will THAT accomplish? Log files are so BOOOOORRRR-ing.

Zen Master: (expressionless) On the contrary, log files are quite complex when viewed under the light of, uhhhhh... enlightenment. You focus on syntax. Focus on semantics.

Student: (sighing) I though I was supposed to focus on my breathing. Or was it a butterfly's wing?

Zen Master: (losing patience) That was yesterday, yesterday. Today we shall...

Student: (really confused) I thought there was no yesterday. (Flips through a spiral-bound notebook) I mean right here I wrote down what you said at breakfast... oh wait, "there is no turkey sausage this morning, only"... No turkey sausage? No, I don't think that's... (flips through pages aimlessly) no that can't be that lousy sausage was defo turkey so...

Zen Master: (angrily) You really are yesterday's lotus flower, aren't you? Let it go already, go, go, go, go, go. You understand nothing. Today you shall understand log files.

Student: (tosses notebook aside like so many lotus flowers) Ok fine pops whatever I'll bite. Log files.

Zen Master: (surprised) Oh. Um, ok, so... ok. So. Log files. Simple in syntax, complex in their semantics, subtle in their... um, subtleties.

Student: Wait. What? Complex in their... sin... tax... wait. (starts to walk towards where he tossed the notebook)

Zen Master: Leave it.

Student: But... but I...

Zen Master: LEAVE. IT. (rubs forehead, grumbles a little at the quality of his latest recruits, makes a mental note to email the Recruitment Department about it later) Ok. Now. Log files.

Student: (very slowly, as if trying to write in a nonexistent notebook envisioned in his mind) Log. Files.

Zen Master: (openly gaping) Yes my mountain goat. Log. Files. Tell me what matters about log files.

Crickets chirp in the fields. A cloud drifts by. Greenland loses another hundred million tons of ice.

Zen Master: Semantics.

Student: (not ok) Ok.

Zen Master: Suppose you need log files as an input to something else beyond just your operations staff for review and profit.

Student: (hearing the word "profit") Now we're talkin! SHOW ME THE MONEY!

Zen Master: (heavier sigh) Something needs to consume log files. That means something needs to be tested with... _test log files_.

Student: Best... smog miles?

Zen Master: LOG FILES LOG FILES TEST LOG FILES.

Student: (still not ok) Ok.

Zen Master: But log files contain possible PII like IP addresses so you'll need to obfuscate those, and you might want to handle user agents as special cases: like bot vs non-bot user agents, or...

Student: (starts jamming to Macklemore in his head)

Zen Master: So for instance, you might want to test you log file consumer with log files from your production site, but with obfuscated global IP addresses, and non-obfuscated local, or loopback, or...

Student: (starts jamming to LMFAO in his head)

Zen Master: And for user agents, you may have certain bots that you deliberately allow (think partners or customers) or perhaps just regularly see in you log files (googlebot, bingbot) and you want to test with those present...

Student: (starts jamming to Rupert Holmes in his head, mutters) if you like pi√±a coladas...

Zen Master: (too full of himself to notice) ... but you want to mix user agents from _real_ devices and users across the spectrum of user agents currently in the wild, at the frequencies they are actually seen in the wild. This matters to sites that filter for fraud, or redirect mobile content to mobile versions of their sites for example, or...

Student: ... and gettin caught in the rain ...

Zen Master: THERE IS NO RAIN. (it starts to rain) PAY ATTENTION.

Student: (dejected and very much not ok at all) Ok.

Zen Master:
